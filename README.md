# AI-Powered Commit Generator

The AI-Powered Commit Generator is a repository that demonstrates the usage of artificial intelligence to automatically generate commit messages for software development projects. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model, this repository aims to streamline the process of creating informative and concise commit messages.

## Features

- **Automated Commit Message Generation**: The AI model analyzes code changes, commit histories, and issue tracking systems to generate commit messages automatically. This saves developers time and effort in crafting detailed commit messages manually.

- **Consistency and Style**: The AI-Powered Commit Generator helps maintain consistency in commit message styles across a project or organization. It adheres to predefined guidelines or patterns to ensure a unified and coherent message structure.

- **Clarity and Readability**: Generated commit messages provide clear and concise summaries of the code changes, effectively communicating their purpose and impact. This improves comprehension and collaboration among team members.

- **Error Prevention**: The AI model assists in reducing human errors in commit messages. It identifies potential issues such as missing references or inadequate descriptions, helping to maintain the quality and accuracy of commit messages.

## Getting Started

To start using the AI-Powered Commit Generator in your software development workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Setting up API Token**: In order to use openAI you need to generate a token:

   ```shell
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<API KEY SHOULD GO HERE.>
   ```

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local development environment.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs-commit
   ```

2. **Setup Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Execution**: Running the script to generate your AI powered commit message run the following command:

   ```shell
   bundle exec puppet-commit
   ```
