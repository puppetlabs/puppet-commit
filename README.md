## Features

- **Automated Commit Message Generation**: The AI model analyzes code changes, commit histories, and issue tracking systems to generate commit messages automatically. This saves developers time and effort in crafting detailed commit messages manually.

- **Consistency and Style**: The AI-Powered Commit Generator helps maintain consistency in commit message styles across a project or organization. It adheres to predefined guidelines or patterns to ensure a unified and coherent message structure.

- **Clarity and Readability**: Generated commit messages provide clear and concise summaries of the code changes, effectively communicating their purpose and impact. This improves comprehension and collaboration among team members.

- **Error Prevention**: The AI model assists in reducing human errors in commit messages. It identifies potential issues such as missing references or inadequate descriptions, helping to maintain the quality and accuracy of commit messages.

## Getting Started
